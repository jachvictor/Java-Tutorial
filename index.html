      Hi dear, welcome to codewithjach java class, here am going to teach few
      things you need to know about java as a beginner. java as a programming
      langusge is a the third most popular language in the world which is used
      for so many purposes such as; android development etc. In this course , we
      going to discuss the:

    <h2 id="section1">About java (history of java)<img src="images/imgcolor2.png" alt="" class="colord"></h2>
    <p>
      Java is a high-level, class-based object oriented programming language
      that is designed to have as few implementation dependecies as possible,
      the syntax of java is similar to C and C++. But has fewer low level
      facilities than either of them .Now, we are going look into the history
      of java, java was originally developed by james gosling at sun micro
      systems in june 1991(which has since been a acquired by oracle) and
      released in 1995 as a core componrnt of sun micro system java platform.the
      idea was create a new language that would allow cosumer electronic devices
      to communicate with each other.also, developers use java to constructs
      applications in laptops, data centres, game consoles, scientific super
      computers, cell phones, and other devices and the salary of a java
      developer is about $75,000 so getting to know and use java is not a bad
      idea.

    <p>
      In order to run java on your pc, you need this two things; a compiler known
      as java development kit(JDK for short) and a code editor, we have many
      code editors like; eclipse, netbean and intellij. You can dowlound any one
      of your choice but i will advice you to go for
      <em>intellij</em>(free community edition)
      , you will be needing jdk SE( standard edition) so just heard to goegle
      chrome and get intellij idea or any code editor of your choice and a JDK
      latest edition. After the dowload, the installation is easy so don't worry
      .Now the installation is done, for you to write your code, you will create
      a new project, after this click on source code at the left side and also
      click on new to create a package or class, we will still discuss what
      packages and classes are. am now going to talk about the Basics of java
      <p><em class="note1">NOTE:</em> make sure to download the ones meant for your opareting system
      (mac, linux,windows 64-bit processor) and also edit them on environment 
      variable account to create thier paths before installation.</p>

    <p>
      To write a code in java, we have what is call
      <em>function</em>, a function is the smallest building block of a java program.
      It can also be referred as a group of code that performs a task, for example; a function that can send messages or search for information,
       we can name our function by specifing our returntype(like String, int etc) if it will return any value, 
       if not then type <em>void</em> which is a reserved keyword for a returntype that <em>won't</em>
       return any value. after this, you can give your fuction a name such as; sendMessages or searchEngine(any name)
       but usually, the first function of our java programm is <em>"main"</em> which is followed by a pair of brackects 
       like this"()" where we pass value and parameters to our funtion and we now add after the bracket, a pair of two brace"{}"",
       this is where our code
       (inbetween the braces) will be written. every function is to belong to a <em>class</em>, remember we talked about class earlier, so 
       a class is a kind of organiser thats contains related functions. For example, just think of a freezer containing 
       different kind of edible stuffs like drinks, solid food, fruits or sacks, now the freezer is the <em>class</em>
       while the edible stuffs are the <em>funtions</em> which will be now called <em>method</em>( a methed is a function
       contained in a class). To write a class, first you need to type the keyword"class" which you can now give it a name
       of your choice, followed by a braces which will contain our method(funtion).let's look into what is called"access modifier"in
       java, this is what determines if our classes and methods can be accessed by other classes and methods, so our classes and methods
       must have an access modifier. There are two main access modifiers in java which are; <em>public</em> and <em>private</em>, they 
       act as thier name implies:public to be accessable and private to be unaccessabie by other classes and methods, an access modifier
       should be written at the beginning of our class name and method name(before writing "class and class name and also before writing the
       returntype/void and main name of your method") followed by <em>static</em>(every  methods should 
       be static which is written after the access modifier).before moving on, we will talk about"packages": it's just what holds and organises
       our classes(that contain the method and our code).So this is just a start in writng a java program, we are now going to discuss the syntax
       of java. Don't worry if u didn't understand how to name classes and methods, here are few images  below for you to understand more
       <p ><em class="note1">NOTE: </em>classes name are named using the <em>PascalNamingConvention</em>(the first latter of each word is in uppercase)
        while mathods name are named using <em>camelNamingConvention</em>(the first latter of each word is in upper case expect the first word)
    <h3>how to name classes and methods in java <img src="images/orange.png" alt="" class="colord"></h3>
      <p class="p1">//procedure for naming a class: <br><u>access modifier</u> <u>keyword</u> <u>ClassName</u><br>
      for example: <br><em class="pu">Public</em> <em class="pu">class</em> <em class="na">Main</em> { <br>}

      <br> 
      <p><em class="note1">NOTE:</em> the shortcut for creating a method is "psvm" and your class will be automatically created
        when you ype in a name by creating a new class in the src(source code). Also, the two forward slashes
      "//" are commenting(commentsor qoutes) in java which won't be executed by the compiler, this makes our
      code more readable

    <p>Hi dear, hope you are learning a lot from this class, if you have grabbed all we have talked about so far, i just want to let you
      know that you a making a progress, so continue with the good work, As you know, constant practice leads to perfection so don't forget
    to practice what you are learning from here,just take a break and try to name a class and metthod by yourself.

    <h2 id="section4">Java syntax<img src="images/imgcolor2.png" alt="" class="colord"></h2>
    <p>Before we discuss about the java syntax, we will first of all know how java works, now the two things java does to execute your code
      are: <em>compliation</em> and <em>execution</em>. In the compilation process, intellij using the java compiler to ompile our code  to
      what is called "byte code", this java compiler comes with the JDk you downloaded(we can check this in the command prompt by typing "javac" )
      .To understand this more, head to the project panel at
      left side of your code editor(intellij) where you will see <the:em>idea <em>src</em></the:em>,remember that the src(source) contains 
      our code, now after the that we see
      the <em>out</em>. The out is the folder that holds our result(the prodution folder that contains our packages and classes), so for you
       to see the out, you have to run your first java code, to run your code
      go to the right top of the editor, you will see a "play" button to run  code which will  run if the code contains no syntax error or else, it will
      crash(your code must have a main method in other to be run), so this is compilation steps.java byte code is platform indepent which means 
      it can run on any opareting system that has a java runtime environment(JRE), the JRE has a software component called java virtual machiine(jvm)
      it now translate the java byte code to a native known to the operating system(be it: window, linux or mac). Don;t get confused at anything
      here, this is just to tell you how java works, is not that relevant.Going into the most important section of this class which is <em>java syntax</em>
      , we are to talk about:</p>
         <P>*<a href="#sysection1">Data type</a></p>
        <p>*<a href="#sysection2">Variables</a></p>
        <p>*<a href="#sysection3">values(assigning a value)</a></p>
        <p>*<a href="#sysection4">operators</a></p>
      <h3 id="sysection1">Data type(primitive and reference) <img src="images/orange.png" alt="" class="colord"></h3>
      <p>In java, we have what is called "datatype", this is responsible for determining the type of value to be assign to our variable
      ,we are still going to talk about variables so don't bother. To explain datatype more, it's just like what specifies the type of data or value
      to be assign to a variable, there are two types of datatypes in java which are <br><em>primitive</em> <br><em>reference</em><br>
      <h4>primitive datatype</h4>
      <p>primitive data types in java are the the predefined data types of java which specify the size and type of any standard values
        .Java has 8 primitive data types which are:
      </p> <br>
      <h5>Byte</h5> "byte" is an integer data type for holding  number values from -128 to 127. The keyword for the byte data type is 
      "byte" <br>
      <h5>short</h5> this is an integer data type for holding number values from -32768 t0 32767
       The keyword for the short data type is "short" <br>
      <h5>Int</h5>:is an integer data type for holding number values from -2,147,483,648 t0 2,147,483,647
       The keyword for the byte data type is "int" <br>
      <h5>Iong</h5>:is an integer data type for holding  number values from 9,223,372,036,854,755,8 to 9,223,372,036,854,755,8
      The keyword for the long data type is "long"
      </p>
      <p> <u><b>table for integer primitive data types </b></u> <br>
        <img src="images/table1.png" alt="" class="color">
    </p>
    <p>
      <h5>double</h5>: A double is a floating point data type for holding decimal number value from 
      1.7e-308 to 1.7e+038
      the keyword for double data type is "double"
      <h5>float</h5>: this is a floating point data type for hold number values from 3.4e-038 to 3.4e+038 <br>
      <img src="images/table2.png" alt="" class="color">
    </p>
    <p><em class="note1">NOTE:</em>integer data type is one which holds whole number values which consist
    of "byte, short, int, and long". the size of the values that can be stored depends on the integer type
    that was choose
    <br>while <br>
  floating point data types are used to represent numbers with a fractional part. <br>
Also, the range of values is calculated as -(2^n-1) to (2^n-1), where n is the number of bits required</p>
<p>
  <h5>Character:</h5>it stores character constants in the memory it assumes a size of 2 bytes, but basically
  it can hold only a single character. just know that character holds only a single character(alphabet)and
  the keyword for this is "char", this also uses single qoute
  <h5>Boolean:</h5> A boolean datatype are used to store conditional statements(true or false statements)
   or values with two states: true or
