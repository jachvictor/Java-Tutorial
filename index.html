    <h1>java class for beginners</h1>
    <p>
      Hi dear, welcome to codewithjach java class, here am going to teach few
      things you need to know about java as a beginner. java as a programming
      langusge is a the third most popular language in the world which is used
      for so many purposessuch as; android development etc. In this course , we
      going to discuss the:

    <h2 id="section1">About java (history of java)</h2>
    <p>
      Java is a high-level, class-based object oriented programming language
      that is designed to have as few implementation dependecies as possible,
      the syntax of java is similar to c and C++. But has fewer low level
      faacilities than either of them .Now, we are going look into the history
      of java, java was originally developed by james gosling at sun micro
      systems in june 1991(which has since been a acquired by oracle) and
      released in 1995 as a core componrnt of sun micro system java platform.the
      idea was create a new language that would allow cosumer electronic devices
      to communicate with each other.also, developers use java to construct
      applications in laptops, data centres, game consoles, scientific super
      computers, cell phones, and other devices and the salary of a java
      developer is about $75,000 so getting to know and use java is not a bad
      idea

    <h2 id="section2">java installation</h2>
    <p class="ppp">
      In order to run java on your pc, u need this two things; a compiler known
      as java development kit(JDK for short) and a code editor, we have many
      code editor like; eclipse, netbean and intellij. You can dowlound any one
      of your choice but i will advice you to go for
      <em>intellij</em>
      , you will be needing jdk SE( standard edition) so just heard to goegle
      chrome and get intellij idea or any code editor of your choice and a JDK
      latest edition. After the dowload, the installation is easy so don't worry
      .Now the installation is done, for you to write your code, you will create
      a new project, after this click on source code at the left side and also
      click on new to create a package or class, we will still discuss what
      packages and classes are. am now going to talk about the Basics of java
    </p>
    <h2 id="section3">Basics of java</h2>

      to write an executable code in java, we have what is called
      <em>function</em>, a function is a
